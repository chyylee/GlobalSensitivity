# GlobalSensitivity

Global Sensitivity analyses are an important tool for exploring systems biology frameworks.

Here we explore how to conduct Latin Hypercube Sampling paired with Partial Correlation Coefficients (LHS-PRCC) and Sobol sequences with Sobol indices in MATLAB without SimBiology. To see an html file of the tutorial, click [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/chyylee/GlobalSensitivity/blob/main/Global_Tutorial.html).

To complete the tutorial, you will need to download and add this package to your path: [GSAT](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40759-global-sensitivity-analysis-toolbox).

The tutorial run file is the "Global_Tutorial.mlx" file, and requires the "ODEfunc.m" file which contains a simple ODE model. The "Sobol_ODEfunc.m" file is needed to use thee GSAT package from MATLAB's file exchange.
